Python3 Django app that can perform User CRUD operations
<hr>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>-Create a Django app that can handle all of the CRUD operations (create, read, update and destroy) for a table.</p>
<p>-Ensure that validation rules are added before saving the records in the database.</p>
<p>-Getting familiar with RESTful routes.</p>
<p>(Right now with Django, it's not quite possible for you to do the full RESTful architecture)</p>
